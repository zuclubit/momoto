## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### For Midjourney
- Use `--style raw` for more realistic UI
- Add `--no illustration, cartoon` to avoid artistic interpretation
- Use `--ar 16:9` for dashboard aspect ratio
- Try `--v 6` for latest version

### For DALL-E 3
- Be very specific about layout positioning
- Mention "UI screenshot" explicitly
- Describe text labels and their positions
- Request "pixel-perfect details"

### For Stable Diffusion
- Use UI-specific models (RealisticVision, etc.)
- Add "(masterpiece, best quality)" to positive prompt
- Strong negative prompts to avoid unwanted styles
- ControlNet with wireframe for layout control

### For Leonardo AI
- Use "Cinematic" or "Creative" presets
- Enable "Prompt Magic" for better interpretation
- Request high resolution (2560x1440)
- Use clear, structured descriptions
