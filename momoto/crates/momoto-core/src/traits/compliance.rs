//! Compliance trait contracts for accessibility and broadcast standards.
//!
//! This module defines a unified interface for validating physical signals and
//! color palettes against external standards (WCAG 2.x, APCA, EBU R128,
//! ADA, etc.).
//!
//! # Design: bounded violation storage
//!
//! `ComplianceReport` stores violations in an [`arrayvec::ArrayVec`] with
//! capacity 8. This bound is deliberate:
//!
//! - No heap allocation in the hot path (rule checks in tight loops)
//! - Predictable memory footprint for WASM (no unbounded Vec growth)
//! - In practice, a single signal rarely violates more than 3–4 rules
//!
//! If more than 8 violations occur, they are silently dropped and
//! `overflow_truncated` is set to `true`. Callers can inspect this flag
//! to decide whether to run a full diagnostic pass at lower frequency.
